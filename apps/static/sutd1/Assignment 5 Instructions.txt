Fifth Assignment (individual work)
Steps
‚ñ° Consider the slot allocation problem described in Slide 43 and 

formulated in slide 49. 

‚ñ° Consider also the slot allocation instance provided under the 

Homework sheet in Ex_SlotAllocation.xls

1.

Compute the solution that would be obtained by allocating flights sequentially, 
i.e. giving priority to the flights that are requested for a longer period - similar to
current slot allocation approaches).

2. Compute the optimal solution using the AMPL model ExampleSlotAllocation.run ‚Äì

do not forget to update the ExampleSlotAllocation.dat

3. Add a new constraint ensuring that no flight can be displaced by more than 2 
periods (maximum displacement = 2) ‚Äì Compute the new optimal solution

4. Consider that the maximum displacement = 1 ; Compute the new optimal 

solution. If no feasible solution can be found, create a new decision variable 
named flight rejected ùëπùíä. The objective function should now have two objectives: 
(i) minimizing the number of flights rejected; (ii) minimizing total displacement. A 
larger weight (e.g. 1000) should be given to objective (i) to minimize first the 
number of flights rejected, and then the total displacement.
